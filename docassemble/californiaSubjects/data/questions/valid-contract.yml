section: Unilateral Contract
question: |
  Unilateral Contract
subquestion: |
  In a unilateral contract, the **offeror promises** to perform in return for the **offeree’s act**. The offeree’s promise to perform is insufficient to constitute acceptance; the offeree must perform the act to accept the offer.

section: Counteroffer
question: |
  Sixth Amendment - Ineffective Counsel
subquestion: |
  The right to counsel encompasses the right to be assisted by a reasonably competent attorney. An attorney is ineffective when (1) representation falls below an objective reasonableness standard, and (2) the deficient performance prejudices the defendant, resulting in an unreliable or fundamentally unfair outcome in the proceeding.
fields: 
  - note: |
      **Common Law**
      
      Generally, an acceptance is effective upon 18posting. At common law, acceptance must mirror the offer terms, neither omitting nor adding terms. Modifications to an offer act as a rejection of the offer and create a new offer (counteroffer).

      **UCC**
      
      Under UCC §2-207, additional or different terms included in the acceptance of an offer generally do not constitute a rejection unless (1) offer expressly limits acceptance to the offer terms, (2) when between non-merchants or a merchant and a non-merchant, the acceptance is made expressly conditional on the offeror’s consent to the additional or different terms, where these terms are a proposal for addition to the contract that is to be separately accepted or rejected, or (3) when both parties are merchants, the additional or different terms are part of the contract unless the terms materially alter the agreement or the offeror objects within a reasonable time.

section: Action – Bilateral Contract
question: |
  Action – Bilateral Contract

      **Past Consideration**
      
      **Traditionally**, past performance before a promise is not bargained for, or done in reliance on the promise. **Modernly**, some courts enforce a promise to prevent unjust enrichment when the **plaintiff expected compensation**, and the **{defendant benefitted}** from the plaintiff’s actions.

subquestion: |
  [In a requirements contract, the buyer agrees to buy all it requires of a product from the seller.] 
  
  [In an output contract, the seller agrees to sell all it manufactures of a product to the buyer.]

section: No Formation Defenses
question: |
  No Formation Defenses
fields: 
  - note: |
      **Undue Influence**
      
      Undue influence occurs when one party is dominant and the other party is dependent, due to lack of expertise, experience, or diminished mental capacity. Generally, the dominant party will be held to a higher fairness and disclosure standard than in a contract between arms-length parties.

  - no label: ui_thus
    datatype: area
    hint: Thus, 
    required: False
  - note: |
      **Duress**
      
      Duress means any wrongful act or threat that deprives a party of meaningful choice. When a party’s agreement results from physical duress, the contract is void. When the duress is a threat, the contract is voidable.
  - no label: duress_here
    datatype: area
    hint: Here, 
    required: False
  - no label: duress_thus
    datatype: area
    hint: Thus, 
    required: False
  - note: |
      **Unilateral Mistake**
      
      A unilateral mistake by one party is insufficient to make a contract voidable, **unless the nonmistaken party** (1) **knew or had reason to know** of the mistake, or (2) had a **duty to disclose** the fact about which the other party was mistaken.
  - no label: um_here
    datatype: area
    hint: Here, 
    required: False
  - no label: um_thus
    datatype: area
    hint: Thus, 
    required: False
  - note: |
      **Mutual Mistake**
      
      Mutual mistake occurs when both parties are mistaken as to an essential contract element. There must be a substantial difference between the contemplated and actual deal, with no intent by the parties to take a risk on the contract element. The contract is generally voidable by the party adversely affected by the mistake.
  - no label: mm_here
    datatype: area
    hint: Here, 
    required: False
  - no label: mm_thus
    datatype: area
    hint: Thus, 
    required: False
  - note: |
      **Misrepresentation**
      
      If a party (1) induces another party to enter into a contract (2) asserting fraudulent misrepresentation (known untrue information), the contract is (3) voidable by the party who justifiably relies on the misrepresentation.
  - no label: misrep_here

    hint: Here, 
    required: False
  - no label: misrep_thus
    datatype: area
    hint: Thus, 
    required: False
  - note: |
      **Unconscionability**
      
      A contract may be voidable where the provisions are one-sided as to be unconscionable at the time the contract is made. The defense is applied where one party has unequal and superior bargaining power over the other party.
  - no label: uncon_here

    hint: Here, 
    required: False
  - no label: uncon_thus
    datatype: area

      **Statute of Frauds**
      
      Scenario 1: [Under the UCC, to be enforceable, agreements for the sale of goods for $500 or more must be in writing.] [The Statute of Frauds requires service contracts that cannot be performed within 34 one year to be in writing and signed by the party to be charged, unless an 35 exception applies.] [The Statute of Frauds requires contracts involving a land interest to be in writing and signed by the party to be charged, unless an exception applies.]

      Scenario 2: [Under the UCC, to be enforceable, agreements for the sale of goods for $500 or more must be in writing] containing 36 (1) identity of parties, (2) contract’s subject matter, (3) terms and conditions, (4) consideration recital, and (5) signature of the party to be charged, unless both parties are merchants. The writing need not be an actual contract, or the terms be contained on one piece of paper. A series of correspondence between the parties may suffice.

  Capacity
subquestion: |
  Parties to a contract must have legal capacity to be held to contractual duties.
fields: 
  - note: |
      **Mental**
      
      If a party with mental illness or defect is **adjudicated mentally incompetent****, contracts made by the individual are **void**. If the party is **not adjudicated** mentally incompetent, contracts are **voidable** and may be **disaffirmed if** the person does **not understand the nature and consequences of the transaction, and the other party has reason to know** of this fact.

  Quasi-contract
subquestion: |
  A court implies a quasi-contract when there is a failed contract, no contract, or divisible contract by implying a promise that requires the defendant to make restitution to the plaintiff. Elements: (1) plaintiff confers defendant a measureable 39 benefit without gratuitous intent, (2) defendant knows or has reason to know of plaintiff’s expectation because defendant had opportunity to decline the benefit, but instead knowingly accepted it, and (3) defendant unjustly enriched if defendant retains the benefit without cost.
