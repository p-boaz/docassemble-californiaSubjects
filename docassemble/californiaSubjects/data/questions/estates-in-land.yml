  Fee Simple Absolute
subquestion: |
  The fee simple absolute is a present estate that **does not terminate**, unless the owner dies intestate without heirs, in which case the property escheats to the state, and gives a person all property rights, including unimpeded rights to (1) **sell or convey all or part**, (2) **devise**.

question: |
  Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent
subquestion: |
  A fee simple subject to a condition subsequent is a present fee simple in which the **grantor reserves**, through **{conditional words}, the right to terminate upon the happening of a stated event**.

  Rule Against Perpetuities
subquestion: |
  No interest in property is valid unless it must vest, if at all, not later than 21 years after some life in being (measuring life) at the creation of the interest.

    required: False
  - note: |
      Property interest vests when given to person in being (living person), and not subject to a condition precedent. 
      
      Example: W’s children alive at the time of W’s death. The children’s interest is not vested because the interest is subject to a condition precedent that they survive W. Rules against perpetuities not relate to time when property vests in actual possession, but when property vests in interest. 
      
      Example: W’s children, A and R. The children’s interest is vested.

terms:
  less than a fee simple absolute: |
    Examples: Life estate, estate for years.
  conditional words: |
    Examples: provided that, on condition that, but if.
  Present Possessory Interests: |
    This list of Estates In Land issues is not complete; contains only topics tested on CA Bar Exam essay questions from 7/2003-2/2015.
  durational language: |
    Examples: so long as, while, during, until. Language needs to limit the duration, not the transfer purpose. If language only limits the purpose, estate is a fee simple absolute. A conveyance that contains durational language and a termination power may be construed as fee simple subject to condition subsequent because the right to terminate is not automatic. Courts try to avoid estate forfeitures.
  vested or contingent: |
    Do what the fact triggers, not both if no facts on both.
  interest not subject to condition precedent: |
    Property cannot vest because known beneficiary subject to condition precedent that has not occurred.
  unascertained taker: |
    Property cannot vest because beneficiary unknown.
