  Authority
subquestion: |
  [`Party name`]’s authority to [`insert facts on what the person did (i.e. sign a contract)`] arose from [`his/her`] role as [`Company`] (1) [`director`] or (2) [`officer title`].
  
  `List the roles from the facts. Facts may have a person being both a director and officer. Do not do both unless facts trigger.`

---
mandatory: True
question: |
  Director
subquestion: |
  A board of directors may act by (1) meeting or (2) unanimous written consent.

  Here, [`list each director’s name`] were [`Company`] directors. Since [`Director`] was not the only director, [`Director`] could not make decisions on [`Director`]’s own in the director role. The board members did not hold a meeting or execute a unanimous written consent to [`insert facts on what Director did`].

  Thus, the authority for [`insert facts on what Director did`] did not come from [`Director`]’s director role.
  
  `If the person is not the only director, the person cannot make decisions alone in the director role. This is an example analysis; tailor to the facts on whether the board members held a meeting or executed a unanimous written consent. Match facts to each keyword from the rules.`
