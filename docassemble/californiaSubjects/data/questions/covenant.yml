question: |
  **{Covenant}**
subquestion: |
  A covenant is a non-possessory interest or promise obligating the holder to (1) do something (burden to run) or (2) refrain from doing something (benefit to run) relating to land.

question: |
  **Burden to Run**
subquestion: |
  For the covenant burden to run, there must be (1) horizontal privity (2) vertical privity, (3) intent, (4) notice, (5) touch and concern, and (6) writing.
  
  *If analyzing whether someone needs to comply with a restriction (i.e. whether landlord needs to comply with lease), do burden to run. If analyzing whether someone gets the benefit of a restriction (i.e. whether assignee gets a lease benefit), do benefit to run. If facts trigger both benefit to run and burden to run, do burden to run first. For benefit to run, refer back on the elements that are the same, and only analyze the elements that differ to save time. It is not possible for both burden and benefit to run to one party. Do both burden and benefit when different covenants or different subsequent landowners succeeding to the same covenant.*
  
  `2 steps:`
  
  `1. Identify subsequent landowner.`
  
  `2. Determine if covenant burdens or benefits subsequent landowner.`
  
    `a. If subsequent landowner held to covenant, do burden to run.`
     
    `b. If subsequent landowner enforcing covenant, do benefit to run.`
      
      P: Privity (Horizontal, Vertical)
      
      I: Intent
      
      N: Notice

      **Horizontal Privity**

      *Unlike burden to run, no notice or horizontal privity elements.*
      
      *Covenants not to compete may not be enforceable to permit the benefit to run when no physical presence on the land. Restricting land use (burden) touches and concerns the land, but the commercial enhancement (benefit) does not affect the physical use of the benefited land. If the covenant is personal to the promisee (benefit does not touch and concern property), courts may find the burden does not run even if touch and concern burdened land.*

question: |
  **Equitable Servitude**
subquestion: |
  For a servitude to be enforced at equity, it requires (1) intent (2) notice (actual, constructive, inquiry) to the party to whom a servitude is being enforced, (3) touch and concern, and (4) writing. If the equitable servitude is enforced, it will allow the enforcing party to obtain a mandatory injunction. An equitable servitude is similar to a covenant except it is enforceable in equity rather than {at law}.

terms: 
  covenant: |
    Covenant is promise between at least 2 parties to do, or not do, something on land. Covenant v. Easement: Covenant restricts land use. Easement is land use right.
    
    There is privity between original contracting parties so to recover damages, the parties sue for breach of the covenant. Whether a covenant runs with the land deals with subsequent landowners. A subsequent landowner doesn’t have privity. A covenant doesn’t run to an original contracting party because the covenant started with the party.
  imposed: |
    Estate and covenant contained in the same instrument (i.e. deed, lease). 
  Vertical Privity: |
    Vertical privity not defined the same for burden to run and benefit to run.
  successor: |
    In landlord-tenant, a burden runs to an assignee, but not a sublessee.
  intend: |
    Look at conveyance language. Example: Grantee covenants for himself, heirs, successors, and assigns.
  Notice: |
    No inquiry notice. Before recording statutes, notice was not required for a covenant to run with the land.
    
    Recording acts caused a notice requirement. Notice can only be actual or constructive.
  constructive or actual: |
    Constructive means recorded in chain of title. Actual means told covenant exists.
  touch and concern: |
    Touch and concern means the covenant increases the land value or use to benefited party, or decreases the land rights or enjoyment to the burdened party.
  Statute of Frauds: |
    If no writing, apply contract law (i.e. prove covenant through part performance or estoppel).
  The successor: |
    In landlord-tenant, a benefit runs to an assignee or a sublessee. Assignee or sublessee can enforce a covenant.
  at law: |
    Analyze covenant first; refer back for equitable servitude. Notice requirement applies only to burden, and there is inquiry notice (unlike covenants). No horizontal or vertical privity for equitable servitude.
  Implied Reciprocal Servitude: |
    Example: D acquired undeveloped land, subdivided the tract into 10 lots. D sold Lot 1 to C. D sold the remaining 9, selling Lot 2 to S. D inserted this clause in each deed: “Purchaser(s) hereby covenant and agree on their own behalf and on behalf of their heirs, successors, and assigns to pay a $600 annual fee for 10 years to ASI for security maintenance within the subdivision.” D properly recorded all 10 deeds. One year later, S sold Lot 2 to B. S’s deed to B did not contain the above-quoted clause. B refuses to pay any security fee.
    
    Prior purchaser v. subsequent purchaser (C v. B): C is the first purchaser so unable to show common plan of residential restrictions at outset of D’s sale to C. No evidence similar covenant restrictions in all deeds. Under majority, C enforces restriction against B, even though D made no covenant in C’s deed, based on (1) third party beneficiary of B’s promise to D, and (2) implied reciprocal servitude attached to D’s retained land at the moment D deeded Lot 1 to C. C enforces an implied servitude on Lot 2, not the express covenant made by B.
  upon written release: |
    Benefited landowner releases burdened landowner.
  Laches: |
    Not defense for covenants. For covenants, use Statute of Limitations.
  previous acts: |
    Example: Plaintiff property owner passively endures multiple covenant violations may be estopped from enforcing covenant against yet another violator
  Unclean Hands: |
    For unclean hands, the wrongful conduct has to relate to the parties’ transaction. There may be facts on the plaintiff doing something wrongful such as putting assets in another person’s name to hide assets from creditors. Unclean hands not a defense if wrongful conduct unrelated to the transaction.
