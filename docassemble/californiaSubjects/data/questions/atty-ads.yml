question: |
  False or Misleading
subquestion: |
  The facts may give an ad with several statements. Make a heading for each statement, and analyze separately whether false or misleading under ABA or CA (whichever law instructed to apply). Evaluate if each statement 
    
    1. contains a material misrepresentation of fact or law, 
    2. omits facts necessary to make the statement as a whole not materially misleading, 
    3. lead a reasonable person to form unjustified expectation that the same results could be obtained without reference to specific factual and legal circumstances, 
    4. unsubstantiated comparisons of fees or services.

  `Whether statement is false or misleading may require first evaluating if another professional responsibility rule is violated. Analyze the violation of the other rule first. Then conclude whether false or misleading. Example: Ad offers interest-free loans for clear liability cases. First evaluate if the ad violates rules relating to financial assistance. If yes, ad is false or misleading.`
