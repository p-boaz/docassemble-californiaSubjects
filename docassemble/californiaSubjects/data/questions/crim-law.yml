  Actual vs Proximate Cause
fields:
  - Actual Cause: actual_cause
    datatype: area
    help: |
      If but for the defendant’s acts, the victim would not have died, the defendant is the actual cause (cause-in-fact) of the death. If there are multiple causes of the death, the defendant is the actual cause when the defendant’s acts are a substantial factor in causing the death.
  - Proximate Cause: proximate_cause
    datatype: area
    help: |
      Proximate cause exists when the victim’s death is a foreseeable result of defendant’s acts. When multiple forces contribute to the death, an unforeseeable intervening event severs the causal connection between a defendant’s acts and a victim’s death.
