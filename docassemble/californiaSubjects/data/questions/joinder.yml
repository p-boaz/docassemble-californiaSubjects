  Service of Process

  Necessary Party
subquestion: |
  A party is necessary if in the person’s absence (1) complete relief cannot be provided to existing parties, (2) disposition may impair the person’s ability to protect his/her interest, or (3) existing parties are exposed to a substantial risk of multiple or inconsistent obligations. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that joint and severally liable tortfeasors are not parties who must be joined.

      `Divide the elements into headings to force an analysis of each part of the rules. When there are few facts on each element or the facts are not controversial, to save time, do the analysis in one paragraph, using the keywords from the rules in the analysis, matching facts to each element.`

mandatory: True
question: |
  Indispensable Party
subquestion: |
  If joinder deprives a court of subject matter jurisdiction, a court considers these factors in deciding whether to proceed in the person’s absence or dismiss the case if the person is indispensable: (1) judgment in the person’s absence prejudices the person or existing parties, (2) prejudice can be reduced by shaping the judgment, (3) judgment in person’s absence will be adequate, and (4) plaintiff will be deprived of an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed.
