  Duty to Control Third Parties
subquestion: |

  Res Ipsa Loquitur
subquestion: |
  *`Res Ipsa Loquitur triggered when no direct evidence of breach.`*

  In the **absence of direct evidence**, the defendant’s breach may be inferred under the res ipsa loquitur doctrine, if the plaintiff proves the accident (1) was the kind that **ordinarily does not occur without negligence**, (2) was caused by an **agent or instrumentality within the defendant’s exclusive control**, and (3) was **not due to plaintiff’s action**.

question: |
  Proximate Cause

question: |
  {Compensatory Damages}
subquestion: |
  In **personal injury**, the plaintiff may recover **special and general damages**, including lost earnings, medical expenses, and pain and suffering. **Foreseeability of the extent of harm** is generally **irrelevant** because a defendant takes a plaintiff as s/he finds the plaintiff.
  
  In **property damage**, the plaintiff may recover the **difference between the fair market value of the property immediately before, and after, the injury, or repair costs if the costs** do not exceed the property value. Damages must be **causal and certain**.

      *`In personal injury fact pattern, analyze the plaintiff has a duty to seek appropriate treatment to effect a cure or healing, but the treatment needs to be reasonable.

section: Defenses
question: |
  Defenses
subquestion: |  
  *`If the interrogatory asks for claims or theories of recovery, do not analyze defenses. If asked for defenses, or whether a plaintiff will prevail, do the defenses the facts trigger.`*
  
  Contributory/comparative negligence, and assumption of risk require fault by the plaintiff. Here, [Plaintiff] did not contribute to the [describe injury], or was aware of the [describe danger] to knowingly and voluntarily assume the risk of harm. Thus, no defenses applied.

  *`When asked for defenses, and the facts do not trigger defenses, still address defenses, but do not use up time to give the rules on each type of defense. Summarize the plaintiff did not contribute to the injury, or was aware of the danger to assume the risk. Conclude no defenses apply.`*

section: Contributory/ Comparative Negligence
question: |
  {Contributory/ Comparative Negligence}
subquestion: |
  Contributory negligence deprives a plaintiff from damages when s/he contributes to the legal cause of injuries by failing to exercise reasonable care for plaintiff’s own safety. At common law, contributory negligence is a complete bar to recovery. In “pure” comparative negligence jurisdictions, a plaintiff’s contributory negligence reduces the recovery of damages by the proportion plaintiff’s fault bears to the total harm. In “partial” comparative negligence jurisdictions, the plaintiff’s recovery is barred if s/he is more than 50% at fault.
fields: 
  - no label: ccn_here
    datatype: area
    hint: Here, 
    required: False
  - note: |
      Contributory/comparative negligence is an objective test. Evaluate whether plaintiff commits negligence upon him/herself. 4 steps:
      
      1. Standard of Care: Determine plaintiff’s standard of care. Reasonable prudent person is default.
      2. Breach: Analyze if plaintiff breached standard of care.
      3. Causation: Evaluate if breach was actual and proximate cause of plaintiff’s injuries.
      4. Damages: Conclude damages barred or reduced.

question: |
  Assumption of Risk

question: |
  {Indemnity}
subquestion: |
  A tortfeasor who discharges liability is entitled to indemnity when (1) actual wrongdoer has a primary duty, (2) by contract, (3) vicarious liability, (4) strict products liability, and (5) tortfeasor fails to discover or prevent actual wrongdoer’s misconduct.

terms: 
  subjective standard: |
    Assumption of risk is a subjective test. Evaluate based on what risks the plaintiff knew or voluntarily assumed.
  Indemnity: |
    Consider Indemnity and Contribution defenses when facts on multiple defendants. Indemnity means 100% liability shifting; full reimbursement. Contribution is liability sharing.
  Contributory/ Comparative Negligence: |
    Do contributory and comparative negligence under one heading to save time. Analysis is similar, except contributory negligence is a complete bar to recovery whereas comparative negligence reduces recovery based on plaintiff’s fault.
  personal injury or property damage: |
    Specify the types of harm allowed.
  Compensatory Damages: |
    For Damages element, just indicate the personal injury or property damages. If the interrogatory specifies a damages issue, detail the types of damages. Example: Under what theory might Patron bring an action for damages against Homeowner?
  Mitigation: |
    Analyze whether damages unavoidable under Mitigation heading. Mitigation deals with plaintiff’s acts after an injury. Contributory or comparative negligence deals with plaintiff’s acts while an injury occurs.
  substantial factor: |
    If there are multiple causes, show defendant’s acts contributed to the plaintiff’s injury. Substantial factor means defendant sets in motion forces that lead to plaintiff’s injury. Conduct is not a substantial factor in causing injury if the same injury occurs without the conduct.
  Proximate cause: |
    2 steps:
    
    1. Show the plaintiff’s injury is foreseeable from defendant’s breach.
    2. Evaluate if intervening events (events between the defendant’s act and the plaintiff’s injury) are unforeseeable to sever the defendant’s liability.
  Eggshell-skull Plaintiff: |
    Eggshell-skull Plaintiff triggered by facts on the plaintiff having unique physical attributes (i.e. hemophiliac), or suffering unforeseeable injuries such as fear, anxiety.
  Negligence: |
    Defenses are not part of the prima facie case. Defenses are for the defendant to raise, not the plaintiff to prove.
  Duty: |
    2 steps:
    
    1. Does defendant owe a duty? Defendant owes a duty if plaintiff is a foreseeable plaintiff. Apply majority and minority views.
    2. If defendant owes a duty, what is the duty? Determine standard of care.
  all harmed: |
    In the analysis, indicate defendant owes plaintiff a duty because plaintiff is in the “all” category. Defendant breaches a duty to all harmed (foreseeable or not) as a result of the breach.
  Firefighters Rule: |
    Firefighters’ Rule triggered when the plaintiff is a public servant (i.e. police, fire). Firefighters’ Rule is not a subtopic of assumption of the risk, but a rule that limits the duty of care that members of the public owe. A member of the public whose conduct precipitates the intervention of a public servant does not owe a duty of care to the public servant with respect to the negligence that caused the intervention. Neighbarger v. Irwin Industries, Inc., 8 Cal.4th 532, 538 (1994). The public servant is employed to confront the risks.
  Standard of Care - Default: |
    3 steps:
    
    1. Type of person the defendant is (i.e. child, professional). Tailor the rule for the standard of care that fits the defendant.
    2. Special relationship between defendant and plaintiff (i.e. common carrier – guest, employer – employee).
    3. Use reasonable prudent person as default if no other applicable standard.
  professional person : |
    Professional means following an occupation, not learned professional (i.e. lawyer, doctor, accountant). Example: Caterer who prepares food needs to apply “cook” standard of a care.
  Generally: |
    2 steps:
    
    1. See if defendant is child (under age 18).
    2. Determine if adult activity: a. Yes: Apply adult reasonable person. b. No: Apply child reasonable person.
