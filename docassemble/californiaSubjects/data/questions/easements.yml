  Step 3: Scope
subquestion: |
  % if creation_type == 'express':
  **Express**

  The terms of the written grant or reservation determines the scope of an express easement. Courts consider the (1) reasonableness of the use and the (2) intent of the original parties to the easement. When the language used to create the easement is too general to determine the specific easement purpose, ambiguities are resolved in favor of the grantee.
  
  % elif creation_type == 'implication':
  **Implication or Necessity**
  
  The scope of an easement by necessity is limited to the nature and extent of the necessity, and is determined by the parties' conduct. Courts consider the easement (1) purpose, (2) reasonable use changes, and (3) future foreseeable use.
  
  % elif creation_type == 'estoppel':
  **Estoppel**
  
  Courts consider the reasonableness of the (1) use and the (2) intent of the original parties to the easement.
  
  % elif creation_type == 'prescription':
  **Prescription**
  
  The scope of an easement by prescription is limited to the nature and extent of the adverse use.

terms: 
  Trespass: |
    Easement may be tested with Trespass. If a party has an easement, consent is a trespass defense. Analyze Trespass issue before Easement.
  appurtenant: |
    Appurtenant means tied to the land. Use the facts to show two tracts of land adjoined.
  transferred with the land: |
    Benefit transferred automatically with dominant estate transfer. Burden transferred automatically with servient estate (burdened estate).
