question: |
  Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law (JMOL)
subquestion: |
  If the court does not grant a JMOL, the court submits the action to the jury subject to the court deciding the legal questions raised by the JMOL. In ruling on the renewed JMOL, the court may (1) allow judgment on the verdict if the jury returned a verdict, (2) order a new trial, or (3) direct the entry of judgment as a matter of law. If the renewed JMOL is granted and the party had alternatively moved for a new trial, the court must determine whether to grant the motion for a new trial if the judgment is reversed or vacated on appeal.
