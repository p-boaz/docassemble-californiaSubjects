    datatype: area
    help: |
      **UCC**: Under the UCC, a request for adequate assurances of performance must be in writing.

    datatype: area
    help: |
      **Anticipatory repudiation** occurs where a promisor, prior to the time to perform arrives, unequivocally indicates s/he will not perform when the time occurs. Anticipatory repudiation gives the non-repudiating party four options: (1) treat the contract as totally repudiated and sue immediately, (2) suspend own performance and wait until performance is due to sue, (3) treat the repudiation as an offer to rescind, and the contract discharged, or (4) ignore the repudiation and urge performance.
