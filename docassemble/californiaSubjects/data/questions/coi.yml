section: Conflict of Interest
question: |
  Conflict of Interest
subquestion: |
  2 ways to approach Professional Responsibility questions:
  
  1. By the events then the issues: Fact pattern has a series of events usually in chronological order. Make a heading for each event with the facts. Under the event heading, make separate issue headings.
  2. By the issues: The same facts generate multiple issues. Example: Same facts for issues on Business Transaction with a Client and Actual Conflict of Interest. Make a heading for each issue.

section: Potential Conflicts of Interest
question: |
  Potential Conflicts of Interest
subquestion: |
  A potential conflict of interest exists when the lawyer suspects a concurrent conflict, but the representation has not yet been materially limited. Under ABA, potential conflicts do not require informed written consent. 
  
  `In CA, without the informed written consent of each client, a lawyer may not represent more than one client in a matter in which the clients’ interests potentially conflict.`

section: Representation Despite Conflicts
question: |
  Representation Despite Conflicts
subquestion: |
  Despite actual conflicts of interest, a lawyer may represent a client if (1) the lawyer reasonably believes s/he will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client, (2) the representation is not prohibited by law, (3) the representation does not involve the assertion of a claim by one client against another client represented by the same lawyer, and (4) each client gives {informed consent in writing}. 
  
  In a criminal case, even when all defendants waive conflict of interest claims, the trial court can still prohibit joint representation. `Add this rule if facts on criminal case involving co-defendants. Wheat v. U.S., 486 U.S. 153 (1988).`
