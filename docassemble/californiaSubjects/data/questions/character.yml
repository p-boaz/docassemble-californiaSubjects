question: |
  How Character Can Be Introduced
subquestion: |
  Character evidence may be offered as substantive, versus impeachment, evidence to (1) prove character when it is the ultimate case issue, or (2) serve as circumstantial evidence of how a person possibly acted.
  
  If character is an ultimate issue, character evidence is admissible by (1) testimony regarding the person’s reputation, (2) the witness’s opinion, or (3) {specific acts}. 
  
  Evidence of a defendant's bad character is generally inadmissible by the prosecutor. An accused may introduce evidence of good character to show innocence of an alleged crime. When the defendant opens the door, the prosecution may rebut the defendant’s claims by attacking the {defendant’s character}.
  
  `A California prosecutor cannot initiate the use of character evidence to prove the defendant’s conduct at the time of the {conduct}.`

terms: 
  character: |
    Character means general behavior patterns.
  "defendant's character": |
    Add rules if a criminal case. In criminal cases, only the accused can initiate because good character may have a tendency to show accused did not commit a crime, unless the prosecution introduces evidence for reasons other than propensity. “Opens the door” means the defendant introducing defendant’s good character or victim’s bad character. Tailor the rules to the facts. 8
  specific acts: |
    FRE 405
  conduct: |
    Add this sentence if asked to apply CA law and a criminal case.
  Character Evidence: |
    3 steps:
    
    1. Character Evidence:
        * Define character evidence.
        * Analyze if evidence is character evidence. Explain character evidence inadmissible to prove conduct in conformity.
    2. How Character Can Be Introduced:
        * Give rules on when character evidence can be introduced.
        * Analyze if the facts fall under the categories.
    3. Admitting Character - MIMIC:
        * Give MIMIC rules. Use separate headings if more than one purpose.
        * Prove the elements using the facts.
  character trait: |
    FRE 404(a). On the exam, when there are facts on bad character evidence, analyze Legal Relevance to conclude the unfair prejudice outweighs the probative value, unless character is an element in a claim or defense. Explain the character evidence confuses or misleads the jury on what the main case issue about, or wastes time in requiring the jury to examine a collateral issue.
    
    Character is directly in issue when proof of character is an element of a claim or defense in a civil case.
    
    Add this rule when character is an ultimate issue in the case (negligent hiring or entrustment, child-custody, defamation).
