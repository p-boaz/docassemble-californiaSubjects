question: |
  Unreasonable [Unconscionable] Fee
subquestion: |
  Under ABA, a lawyer cannot charge unreasonable fees. Factors in determining whether a fee is reasonable include (1) time and labor required, novelty and difficulty of the questions, and skill requisite to perform the legal service properly, (2) likelihood representation will preclude the lawyer from accepting other employment, (3) customary fee in the locale for the kind of work, (4) amount involved and results obtained, (5) time limits imposed by the client or circumstances, (6) nature and length of the client professional relationship, (7) lawyer's experience, reputation, and ability, and (8) whether fixed or contingent fee. 
  
  CA prohibits unconscionable fees, and uses factors similar to the ABA for determining unreasonable fees to determine unconscionable fees, in addition to the following factors: (1) whether the lawyer engaged in “fraud or overreaching” in negotiating or setting the fee; and (2) whether the lawyer has failed to disclose material facts.
