terms: 
  Abuse of process: |
    Abuse of Process usually tested with Malicious Prosecution.
  ulterior purpose: |
    Purpose other than what process intended. Merits of action irrelevant.
  institution of a criminal proceeding: |
    Example: Filing police report to procure plaintiff’s arrest.
  improper purpose: |
    Not bring case to seek justice (malice).
  dismissed in plaintiff favor: |
    Termination of underlying case demonstrates defendant’s innocence (termination based on merits, not procedure).
  insufficient probable cause: |
    Sufficient probable cause: (1) grand jury indictment, (2) conviction, even if subsequently reversed on appeal, or (3) instituted proceeding on advice of attorney. Insufficient probable cause: (1) not enough facts for a reasonable person to believe plaintiff was guilty or (2) defendant not actually believe plaintiff was guilty. Probable cause difficult to show in civil cases; people often file doubtful cases.
  damages: |
    Need to prove damages. Examples: Expenses in defending criminal proceeding, reputation harm, emotional distress, punitive damages.
