  % if chooses_conveyance['life estate']:
  Based on your responses, you can confirm that this is a **life estate**
  
  A life estate is followed by either a **remainder** or **reversion**. 
    
    % if after_le['to third party']:
  You answered that the interest went to a third party, so that makes it a **remainder**.
      
      % if asc_person and no_cond_prec:
  You answered that the interest went to an **ascertainable person** and there are **no conditions precedent** that must be satisfied before the remainder is **certain to become possessory**. Therefore, this is a **vested remainder**
  
  **Vested remainders are always devisable by will** (and in the absence of a will they pass according to the intestacy statute).
  
      % else:
  This is a **contingent** remainder. 
      % endif
    % else:
  In this case, the interest went back to grantor or grantor heirs, so it's a **reversion**.
    % endif
  % endif
  % if chooses_conveyance['fee simple']:
  You said this was a fee simple - we're working on developing this answer more...
  % endif

  In Python, `chooses_conveyance` is
  `${ repr(chooses_conveyance) }`.
