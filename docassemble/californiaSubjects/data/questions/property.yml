  1. The **fee simple absolute** is a present estate that does not terminate, unless the owner dies intestate without heirs, in which case the property escheats to the state, and gives a person all property rights, including unimpeded rights to (1) sell or convey all or part, (2) devise.
  2. A **fee simple determinable** is a present fee simple limited by specific durational language such that it terminates automatically upon the happening of a stated condition, and full property ownership reverts to the grantor.
  3. A **fee simple subject to a condition subsequent** is a present fee simple in which the grantor reserves, through conditional words, the right to terminate upon the happening of a stated event. The fee simple does not automatically terminate upon the occurrence of the event, but when the grantor acts to recover possession.
  4. A **life estate** is a present possessory interest limited in duration by a life.

  1. A **possibility of reverter** is a future interest that arises automatically in the grantor as a consequence of conveying a fee simple determinable. Upon the occurrence of the stated condition, the estate automatically reverts to the grantor.
  2. A **reversion** is a future interest the grantor retains when the grantor transfers less than a fee simple absolute to a third person.
  3. A **right of reentry** is a future interest the grantor expressly reserves after granting a life estate or fee simple on condition subsequent.
  4. A **remainder** is a future interest created in a grantee that takes effect after the expiration of a prior possessory estate. A remainder can be [vested or contingent].

  **Lawful execution of a deed**
  
  * The deed must be in writing signed by the grantor.  Don’t need to recite consideration.  
  * Deed must include description of the land but doesn’t have to be perfect.  
  
  **Delivery req**
  
  * Delivery req can be satisfied when grantor physically or manually transfers the deed to the grantee.  
  * However, delivery doesn’t necessarily require actual physical transfer of the deed.  Test is solely of present intent.  
  * Recipient’s express rejection of the deed defeats delivery.
  * If a deed, absolute on its face, is transferred to grantee w/ an oral condition then the oral conditions drops out.  
  * Delivery by escrow OK.  Advantage is title can still pass after grantor dies.  

  **Covs for title and 3 types of deed**:
  
  1. Quitclaim deed
      * No covs.  Seller not even promising he even has title to convey.
  2.	General warranty deed

      * Promises he has not conveyed this estate to anyone other than grantee, and
      * Promises that the estate is free from encumbrances made by grantor.

  For **burden** to run with the land and bind successor of burdened estate require writing, intent, notice of covenant by BFP of land (actual, inquiry, or constructive/record notice), horizontal privity, vertical privity, and touch & concern

  1. Intent: Original covenanting parties intended that the terms be enforceable by successors or assignees
    * Intent may be implied if covenant touches & concerns land or covenant is in writing
  2. Horizontal privity: Relationship b/w original covenanting pts who shared interest in land (e.g., grantor-grantee)
  3. Vertical privity: Relationship b/w covenanting pts and their successors in interest. Successor must take covenanting pt’s entire interest for burden to run (not a lesser estate such as life estate from fee simple absolute)
  4. Touch & concern land: Covenant directly reduces use or enjoyment of the servient land, or increases obligations
