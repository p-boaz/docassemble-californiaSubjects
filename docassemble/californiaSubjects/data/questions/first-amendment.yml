question: |
  Prior Restraint
subquestion: |
  A prior restraint regulates speech in advance of expression. Prior restraints are generally presumed unconstitutional, except when (1) **particular harm can be avoided**, and (2) **procedural safeguards** are provided to the speaker, including **narrowly drawn, reasonable, and definite standards**.

      **Collateral Bar Rule**
      
      The {collateral bar rule} prevents individuals from **challenging a court order** if they disobey the order before appealing the order through appropriate proceedings. Courts preserve their abilities to direct the methods for challenging judicial orders to ensure that individuals do not become the judges in their own cases.

  Time, Place, and Manner Restrictions
subquestion: |
  The government’s ability to regulate time, place, and manner of speech varies with the forum in which the speech takes place.
field: continue

section: Public Forum
question: |
  Public Forum
subquestion: |
  A public forum may be traditional or {designated}. {Traditional public forums} are historically associated with expression. A designated public forum is not historically used for speech activities, but the government opens for such use. To be valid, government speech regulation in public forums must be (1) content neutral, (2) substantially related to an important government interest, and (3) leave open alternative communication channels.
  
  Here, the [place of speech] was a [traditional/designated] public forum because [____].

section: Nonpublic Forum
question: |
  **Nonpublic Forum**
subquestion: |
  A nonpublic forum is all public property that is not a traditional or designated public forum. The government may regulate speech activities in nonpublic forums as long as the regulation is (1) viewpoint neutral, and (2) rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Viewpoint neutral means the government may prohibit speech on certain issues altogether, but not allow only one side of an issue to be presented.

question: |
  Commercial Speech
subquestion: |
  The First Amendment protects commercial speech that is truthful, not misleading, and concerns lawful activity. Regulation of commercial speech is permissible when the regulation (1) serves a substantial government interest, (2) advances that interest directly, and (3) is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.
