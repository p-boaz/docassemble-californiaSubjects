question: |
  Authority
subquestion: |
  [`Party name`]’s authority to [`insert facts on what the person did (i.e. sign a contract)`] arose from [`his/her`] role as [`Company`] (1) [`director`] or (2) [`officer title`].
  
  `List the roles from the facts. Facts may have a person being both a director and officer. Do not do both unless facts trigger.`

question: |
  Director
subquestion: |
  A board of directors may act by (1) meeting or (2) unanimous written consent.

  Here, [`list each director’s name`] were [`Company`] directors. Since [`Director`] was not the only director, [`Director`] could not make decisions on [`Director`]’s own in the director role. The board members did not hold a meeting or execute a unanimous written consent to [`insert facts on what Director did`].

  Thus, the authority for [`insert facts on what Director did`] did not come from [`Director`]’s director role.
  
  `If the person is not the only director, the person cannot make decisions alone in the director role. This is an example analysis; tailor to the facts on whether the board members held a meeting or executed a unanimous written consent. Match facts to each keyword from the rules.`

terms: 
  principal’s manifestations: |
    Evaluate events between principal and third party; spoken or written word, conduct.
  Ratification: |
    If the person did not have authority, analyze if the board of directors held a meeting to ratify the person’s act.
  partnership debts: |
    Debts can be based on tort or contract.
  Duty of Care: |
    Duty of Care triggered when a partner does not obtain permission from other partners to act contrary to express partnership terms. 
    
    Example: Partner1 has exclusive express authority to buy furniture. Partner2 violates the duty of care if Partner2 buys a chair without Partner1’s permission.
  profit: |
    Do not need to share losses.
  Totality of the Circumstances: |
    To make it easier to read, use spaces before and after headings, and indent when one topic is a subtopic of another.
  Factors: |
    “Factors” means this is a balancing test. Analyze each factor, and then do a weighing in the conclusion.
  veil: |
    List only the factors the facts trigger. Do at least 3 so there can be a balancing. The often tested factors are undercapitalization, alter ego, fraud.
  at the time of formation: |
    If the company is going out of business or in debt, see if the undercapitalization was at the time of formation.
  Deep Rock Doctrine: |
    Bankruptcy fact scenario.
  equity requires, controlling shareholders’ claims as creditors: |
    Examples: Fraud, gross mismanagement, bad faith.
  subordinated to outside creditors’ claims: |
    Court has discretion to subordinate shareholders’ claims to any class of creditors, even unsecured creditors.
  In conclusion,: |
    See how many factors go towards the party suing and how many for the shareholders. If there are more factors for the shareholders, conclude no piercing.
  Interstate commerce: |
    The scheme to defraud, not the trade, has to be executed by use of interstate commerce. Interstate commerce used to make a material misrepresentation or omission. No interstate commerce if in person.
  material misstatement or omission of fact: |
    **SEC Rule 10b-5 violation** deals with making **untrue statements** to defraud people. **Rule 10b-5 violation based on insider trading** relates to using **true statements** for self gain.

    Focus on plaintiff buy or sell. Defendant not need to participate in transaction. “In connection” means the fraudulent conduct (i.e. breach of fiduciary duty) coincides with securities transaction.
  Rule 10b-5 prohibits: |
    “Insider” means person with duty of trust and confidence to issuer, shareholders of issuer, or source of material nonpublic information. “Inside” means material nonpublic.
