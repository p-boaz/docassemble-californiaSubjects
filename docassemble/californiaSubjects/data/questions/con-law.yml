  Here's the Constitutional Law  summary:
subquestion: |
  % if main_issue == 'Commerce Clause':
  Congress can regulate **four categories** of activities involving interstate commerce:
    
  * ${ com_c_one }
  * ${ com_c_two }
  * ${ com_c_three }
  * ${ com_c_four }
    % if state_statute: 
      % if sup_clause == 'Neither':
  With no express authorization or prohibition by Congress, you have to determine if the federal law preempts the state law
      % else:
  Since there was express authorization or prohibition by Congress, the state law will be judged on the Supremacy Clause.
      % endif
    % endif
  % endif
  
  % if main_issue == 'Contracts Clause':
    % if contract_predates: 
      % if mod_permissible: 
      % endif
    % else: 
  There is no Contracts Clause implication because states ***can*** regulate contract formation ***prospectively***.
    % endif
  % endif
    
  % if main_issue == 'Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment':
    % if classification:
  You've indicated this is an ***equal protection problem*** since there is a ***classification***.
      % if govt_action:
        % if level_of_scrutiny == 'Freedom of expression':
          % if freedom_types:
          % endif
        % endif
      % endif
    % else: 
      % if proc_or_subst == 'Procedural':
  When dealing with procedural due process, yuo'll ask if notice and a hearing are necessary when a right is removed. 
      % else: 
  Substantive due process becomes an issue when state action substantially interferes with a ***"fundamental"*** right. This then requires Strict Scrutiny. **Burden of Persuasion** is another issue. Here's the rule: If the impaired right is fundamental, then the burden of persuasion is on the ***person attacking*** the government's action. 
      % endif
    % endif
