question: |
  Procedural Due Process
subquestion: |
  When government action adversely affects libery or property interests, the court asks two questions in determining procedural due process: (1) Is the **threatened interest protected?**, (2) If the threatened interest is protected, what **process** is **due** to **plaintiff**?

  Threatened Interest Protected

question: |
  Process Due Plaintiff
subquestion: |
 If government action threatens a protected interest, the court considers three factors in determining the process due: (1) private interest affected, (2) value of procedural safeguards, and (3) fiscal and administrative burden in providing the additional or substituted process.

question: |
  **Substantive Due Process**
subquestion: |
  The substantive due process clause guarantees the fairness of law and that laws will be reasonable and not arbitrary.
  
  *A regulation that affects a specific classification triggers Equal Protection. A regulation that affects all triggers Substantive Due Process. Read the regulation to see if it involves more than one group.*
  
  *If a regulation mentions only one group, the issue is substantive due process. Do not think it is equal protection based on how the regulation benefits another group. Example: A regulation bans disposable diapers for environmental reasons. As a result of the regulation, diaper services for cleaning cloth diapers become profitable, but a study finds no improvement in the environment.*
  
  *If the regulation mentions at least two groups, the issue is equal protection. Example: A jail supervisor tells Ada that she can be designated a jail chaplain if she obtains a letter from a recognized religious group stating it has ordained Ada as a minister and endorsed her for such work. There are two classifications based on ordained v. not ordained, and recognized religious group v. not recognized religious group.*

terms: 
  on its face: |
    The law, by its own terms, makes an explicit distinction between classes of persons. Example: The Corps drafts boys ages 15 to 18 who have dropped out of school.
  in its application: |
    A law, neutral on its face, is invalid if the plaintiff proves government action had a discriminatory purpose when applying the law differently to different classes of persons. Example: Peremptory challenge is an equal protection violation when plaintiff proves attorney excluded a potential juror based on race or sex. Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).
  discriminatory motive: |
    A law, neutral on its face and in application, is invalid if it has a disproportionate impact on a class of persons and the plaintiff proves the law maker enacted or maintained the law for a discriminatory purpose. Statistical Evidence on Disproportionate Impact + Evidence on Legislative Intent = Discriminatory Motive.
  compelling state interest: |
    The government has the burden of proving the elements. Usually the government loses so make it turn out that way in the analysis.
  Fifth: |
    Use the Fourteenth Amendment for state government. Use the Fifth Amendment for federal government. No equal protection clause in the Bill of Rights. Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954) stretched Fifth Amendment “due process” to require the federal government to afford equal protection of the laws.
  individuals: |
    Do not waste time with an introduction on the different scrutiny levels. Identify the classification. Then give the rules only for the level of scrutiny for the classification.
  Compelling Interest: |
    Analyze the government interest first. Cannot determine if the means used to achieve an interest are necessary and least restrictive when do not know what the interest is. If no mention of the government interest in the facts, base the interest on police powers (i.e. health, safety, welfare).
  Necessary: |
    The law is not whether the government action is necessary, but whether the action is necessary to achieve the government interest.
  Suspect Class: |
    Input the suspect class (national origin, race, alienage) in the heading. Alienage: Use strict scrutiny for state laws that discriminate against aliens, except laws that prohibit aliens from the democratic process (i.e. voting, jury duty), working as a notary public, or government employment (i.e. police officers, public school teachers, probation officers). Use rational basis for state exceptions and federal laws. Federal alienage classification is likely valid unless it is arbitrary and unreasonable because Congress has plenary power over aliens under Article I.
  Equal Protection: |
    * A regulation that affects a specific classification triggers Equal Protection. A regulation that affects all triggers Substantive Due Process. Read the regulation to see if it involves more than one group.
    
    * If a regulation mentions only one group, the issue is substantive due process. Do not think it is equal protection based on how the regulation benefits another group. Example: A regulation bans disposable diapers for environmental reasons. As a result of the regulation, diaper services for cleaning cloth diapers become profitable, but a study finds no improvement in the environment.
    
    * If the regulation mentions at least two groups, the issue is equal protection. Example: A jail supervisor tells Ada that she can be designated a jail chaplain if she obtains a letter from a recognized religious group stating it has ordained Ada as a minister and endorsed her for such work. There are two classifications based on ordained v. not ordained, and recognized religious group v. not recognized religious group.
