  Capacity: |
    If there are not enough facts to breakdown analysis into the elements, use in one paragraph, but mention each element in the order listed in the rules.
  must sign: |
    In CA, no need to sign at end.
  In CA, an interested witness is competent: |
    Add this rule if facts on interested witness (witness is a will beneficiary). If there is an interested witness, the facts usually also test Undue Influence and Intestate Succession. Interested witness issues should be ordered under a heading for the party who is the interested witness, not part of the Valid Will analysis.
  Harmless Error: |
    Do Harmless Error if witnessing requirements not met.
  In conclusion,: |
    Conclude there is a valid formal will if each element met.
  material terms: |
    Examples: Gifts, beneficiaries.
  conclusion: |
    Conclude there is a valid holographic will if each element met.
  valid will: |
    If the facts do not give a valid will, do separate issue on Valid Will.
