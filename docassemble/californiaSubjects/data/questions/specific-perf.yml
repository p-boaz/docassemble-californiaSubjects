question: |
  Feasible Enforcement
subquestion: |
  A court will not specifically enforce a promise if enforcement imposes court burdens that are disproportionate to the advantages gained from enforcement, and the harms suffered from denial. Performance that entails continuous supervision, or involves suitability judgment will generally not be ordered.

question: |
  Anticipatory Repudiation
subquestion: |
  Anticipatory repudiation occurs where a promisor, **prior to the time to perform arrives, unequivocally indicates** s/he **will not perform** when the time occurs. Anticipatory repudiation gives the non-repudiating party **four** options: (1) treat the contract as **totally repudiated** and **sue immediately**, (2) **suspend** own **performance** and **wait until performance is due to sue**, (3) treat the repudiation as an offer to **rescind**, and the contract as **discharged**, or (4) **ignore** the repudiation and **urge performance**.

  No Unfairness

  Laches
subquestion: |

  Bona Fide Purchaser

question: |
  Unilateral Mistake
subquestion: |
  A unilateral mistake by one party is insufficient to make a contract voidable, unless the **non-mistaken party** (1) **knew or had reason to know** of the mistake, or (2) had a **duty to disclose** the fact about which the other party was mistaken. A defendant’s actions that do not rise to the level of a contract defense for mistake can nevertheless be a factor that results in the denial of specific performance.

question: |
  Hardship
subquestion: |
  Hardship can be a factor in not granting specific performance when events that occur after contract formation fall short of impracticability, impossibility, or frustration of purpose, but cause unreasonable hardship to the **defendant and third parties**.

question: |
  Inadequate Consideration
subquestion: |
  While inadequate consideration is not generally grounds for granting contract relief, gross inadequate consideration can be a factor that weighs in favor of contract unfairness.

question: |
  Unconscionability
subquestion: |
  A contract may be voidable where the provisions are one-sided as to be unconscionable at the time the contract is made. The defense is applied where one party has unequal and superior bargaining power over the other party. Unconscionability may be a factor in denying specific performance though it may not be a contract formation defense.

question: |
  Misrepresentation
subquestion: |

  The right: |
    Laches is not a defense if there is delay without prejudice to the defendant.
  Unclean hands: |
    For unclean hands, the wrongful conduct has to relate to the parties’ transaction. There may be facts on the plaintiff doing something wrongful such as putting assets in another person’s name to hide assets from creditors. Unclean hands not a defense if wrongful conduct unrelated to the transaction.
  Heading for Item 1: |
    Evaluate based on the bargain for exchange items. If more than one item bargained for (i.e. money, publicity, reputation), make a heading for each item, and analyze if speculative, unique, etc.
  more definite: |
    Terms must be more definite and certain than in a money damages action.
  Item 1: |
    Facts may have more than one item bargained for (i.e. water rights, land). Make a heading for each item, and analyze if feasible to enforce separately. 
    
    Example: Plaintiff contracted to purchase 3 items from the defendant, but defendant did not own 2 items. Evaluate whether defendant owns item, and if defendant and property within court’s jurisdiction. Feasible to enforce the defendant giving the plaintiff the items the defendant owned, but not the items the defendant did not own.
