terms: 
  landlord/remainder interest: |
    Fill in the relationship between the parties (i.e. life estate – remainder, landlord-tenant).
  tenant/life estate holder: |
    If a life estate holder commits waste, the claim extinguishes upon the person’s death. At death, the person no longer possesses the property. The remainder interest cannot sue the person’s estate for damages the life estate holder committed before death.
  ameliorative waste: |
    On the exam, tailor the rules to the facts. List only the type of waste the facts trigger. Unnecessary to mention a type of waste if no facts.
  Voluntary: |
    Make headings for each type of waste the facts trigger.
  neglect: |
    Neglect means failure to keep up property. Example: Tenant has duty to make ordinary repairs to keep property in same condition as at lease term commencement, excluding ordinary wear and tear, unless tenant covenanted.
  failure to reasonably protect property: |
    Example: Life tenant fails to pay mortgage interest payments, taxes, or special assessments.
