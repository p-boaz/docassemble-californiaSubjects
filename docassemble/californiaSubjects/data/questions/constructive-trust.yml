terms: 
  Under the majority, the Statute of Fraud bars constructive trust for breach of an oral promise: |
    Add this sentence for contracts fact patterns. Constructive trust does not apply to an oral agreement if the agreement is required to be in writing, unless there is a statue of frauds exception or fraudulent promise.
  traced: |
    No constructive trust when the defendant’s property cannot be traced solely to plaintiff’s property (i.e. defendant’s property improved with plaintiff’s property, plaintiff’s funds commingled with defendant’s property).
  Inadequate: |
    No constructive trust if able to obtain money damages (i.e. restitution, compensatory damages).
  Unclean Hands: |
    For unclean hands, the wrongful conduct has to relate to the parties’ transaction. There may be facts on the plaintiff doing something wrongful such as putting assets in another person’s name to hide assets from creditors. Unclean hands not a defense if wrongful conduct unrelated to the transaction.
  Equitable Lien: |
    Equitable lien gives someone owed a payment priority in getting paid over other creditors. 
    
    `Example`: G owes N $220K. G uses $220K to buy a boat. G has other debts. N can put an equitable lien on the boat such that if G sells the boat N gets paid before other creditors. Lien has to be on property traced to property belonging to N. G used the $220K to buy a boat so the boat is traced to $220K that belongs to N. G holds title to the boat. If G was able to keep the boat, G would be unjustly enriched because $220K belonged to N.
  In conclusion: |
    Conclude if Statute of Frauds met, or an exception makes the contract enforceable.
