fields:
  - (1): ec_impact
  - (2): extent
  - (3): character
help: |         
  1. economic impact of the regulation on a property owner,
  2. extent the regulation interferes with an owner’s reasonable, investment-backed expectations regarding property use, and

  Fifth Amendment: |
    Signal Constitutional Law issues with the amendment number. Taking may be tested with Zoning, Equal Protection, Due Process.
  taking: |
    If facts deal with state or local government taking, do Tenth Amendment to show the source of power for the taking (police power – health, safety, morals, welfare).
  rationally related: |
    Rational basis test. The plaintiff has the burden of proving the elements. Usually on the exam, try to make the plaintiff lose in the analysis.
  legitimate government interest: |    
    Public Use means public purpose. Example: Taking when City transfers private property to private developer because public benefits from development. Kelo v. City of New London, 545 U.S. 469 (2005). 
    
    2 steps for rational basis test:
    
      1. Legitimate government interest
      2. Whether regulation is rationally related to the interest.
  fair market value: |      
      Reasonable property value at time of taking measured in terms of owner loss, not government gain.
