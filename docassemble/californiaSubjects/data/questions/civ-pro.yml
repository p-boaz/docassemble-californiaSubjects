  Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law
fields:
  - Define: jmol_def
    datatype: area
    help: |
      A motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) may be brought after the close of plaintiff's evidence or at the close of all trial evidence. A JMOL is granted if no reasonable person could differ as to the trial outcome.
  - Renewed JMOL: renewed_jmol
    datatype: area
    help: |
      If the court does not grant a JMOL, the court submits the action to the jury subject to the court deciding the legal questions raised by the JMOL. In ruling on the renewed JMOL, the court may (1) allow judgment on the verdict if the jury returned a verdict, (2) order a new trial, or (3) direct the entry of judgment as a matter of law. If the renewed JMOL is granted and the party had alternatively moved for a new trial, the court must determine whether to grant the motion for a new trial if the judgment is reversed or vacated on appeal.
  - Time for Renewed JMOL: time_renewed_jmol

      The movant may file a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law no later than 28 days after the entry of judgment. If the motion addresses a jury issue not decided by a verdict, the renewed motion must be filed no later than 28 days after the jury was discharged.
